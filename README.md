Project Description

The Smart Home Automation System is a C-based project that simulates automation of home appliances such as lights, fans, and other devices.
The system allows users to control and monitor household devices through a simple, menu-driven interface, demonstrating how automation logic works at a basic level.

This project is designed for academic purposes and helps in understanding embedded-system concepts, control logic, and C programming fundamentals.
